## Middleware

### What is Middleware?

Middleware is software that is used to bridge the gap between applications and other tools or databases. Middleware sits between an operating system and the applications that run on it. It is effectively software that provides a method of communication and data management between applications that would otherwise not have any way to exchange data -- such as with software tools and databases.
