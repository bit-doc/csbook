title:Data Compression
---

Compression is used to reduce file sizes â€“ something which is essential in an era of online video streaming and media sharing.

Without compression, we would:

- Fit less music, videos or photos onto your smart phone or computer
- Struggle to stream or download videos from the internet
- Struggle to upload media to the internet
- Find browsing websites a slower experience
Compression can be categorised as either lossy or lossless.
