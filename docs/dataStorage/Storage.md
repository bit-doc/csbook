## Data Storage Capacity
Data storage capacity is the measurement of how much data can be stored in a storage device

Data storage capacities are measured in bytes, where each byte is actually a pattern of 8 bits

### bit
Each bit is represented by either a 1 or a 0 (on or off), also known as binary code.

### byte
1 byte can hold 1 character of data, e.g. “p” is 1 byte.

```
1 byte = 8 bits (e.g. 10011011)
```

```
Name	Bytes	Context
1 kilobyte (1 KB)	2^10 (or 1 024)	A few paragraphs of text
1 megabyte (1 MB)	2^20 (or 1 048 576)	4 books of text
1 gigabyte (1 GB)	2^30 (or 1 073 741 824)	4,400 books, or 256 MP3 audio files
1 terabyte (1 TB)	2^40 (or 1 099 511 627 776)	233 DVDs, or 260,000 MP3 audio files
1 petabyte (1 PB)	2^50 (or 1 125 899 906 842 624)	40,000 Blu-ray discs, or 268,400,000 MP3 audio files
