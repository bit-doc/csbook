## Gates and Circuits

> A gate is a device that performs a basic operation on electrical signals.A gate accepts one or more input signals, and produces a single output signal. There are several specific types of gates;
> Gates are combined into circuits to perform more complicated tasks

- There are three different, but equally powerful, notational methods for
describing the behavior of gates and circuits:
    - Boolean expressions
    - logic diagrams
    - truth tables
